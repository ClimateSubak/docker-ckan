# Climate Subak

Subak is an accelerator for not-for-profit organisations fighting climate change with data and tech.

> Our mission is to save the planet with shared data. We believe that creating a supportive ecosystem around climate not-for-profits will lead to faster and better climate action.

## Data Cooperative

>Connecting climate data to improve climate outcomes

We believe open data is a key driver of innovation
However too often in the climate sector, valuable insights remain siloed within organisations.  Climate data is opaque, messy and locked away.  We’re looking to change that. 

The Data Cooperative will allow Subak members, fellows and other climate change organisations to support stronger climate insights, identify climate risks and opportunities, and to measure climate impact.

The Data Cooperative is three things:  
 
1. A community of likeminded folks (is this you?)
2. Guidance and documentation for your open climate data journey
3. The Data Catalogue (you are here) - a web portal of open data assets, hopefully the first of many tools we'll build

## This site - the Data Catalogue 
Strictly this site is a *metadata* catalogue - data about data. 
We at Subak aren't creating datasets of our own, and we don't want to mirror other folks datasets. What we want to do is catalogue what is already out there, signpost and increase visibility, and increase the quality of what is already being shared. That means more emphasis on metadata standards, machine readability and data quality. 

## Tools
This website runs using CKAN. In their own words:

>CKAN is the world’s leading open-source data portal platform.
>
>CKAN is a complete out-of-the-box software solution that makes data accessible and usable – by providing tools to streamline publishing, sharing, finding and using data (including storage of data and provision of robust data APIs). CKAN is aimed at data publishers (national and regional governments, companies and organizations) wanting to make their data open and available.

>CKAN is used by governments and user groups worldwide and powers a variety of official and community data portals including portals for local, national and international government, such as the UK’s data.gov.uk and the European Union’s publicdata.eu, the Brazilian dados.gov.br, Dutch and Netherland government portals, as well as city and municipal sites in the US, UK, Argentina, Finland and elsewhere.
