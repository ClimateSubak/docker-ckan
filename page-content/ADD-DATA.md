We are thrilled you want to join us in improving access to climate data.

Right now we are curating climate datasets ourselves as Subak. 
But soon we will welcome everyone to contribute.  
If you'd like us to help share your data, let us know at [datacooperative@subak.org](mailto:datacooperative@subak.org).  

If you can't find the climate data you want, please [tell us via the data request form](https://airtable.com/shrakRbosU1b6QjLZ). 

## Issues

If your data doesn't already have a home online, we can help you publish it somewhere.  
If you would like to see data that is behind a paywall appear in the Data Catalogue, we can't of course help get it in front of the paywall, but we can catalogue it and point the community to where the data is so they can find it more easily.  
If you're not sure your data is the right fit - just ask  
If your data is very large - then we can point you to places that are able to host that for you  
If you don't know how to license your data - we can help   

Please get in touch with any issues at [datacooperative@subak.org](mailto:datacooperative@subak.org)
