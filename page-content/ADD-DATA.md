We are thrilled you want to join us in improving access to climate data.

Right now we are curating climate datasets ourselves as Subak. 
But soon we will welcome everyone to contribute.

For now, if you'd like see something on here, please tell us at 
 [datacooperative@subak.org](mailto:datacooperative@subak.org) with the subject line DATA

If you want to speed things up you can give us some details. 
Get your dataset. You need to know and supply its name, a good description, 
and a direct link to the resource online. A spreadsheet or CSV file might 
have a direct URL you can provide, or it might be better just to link to 
the dataset homepage. 

## Issues
If you hit any of these, please get in touch at [datacooperative@subak.org](mailto:datacooperative@subak.org)

If your data doesn't already have a home online, we can help you publish it somewhere.  
If you'd like to see data behind a paywall, we can't help with that directly, but we'd still like to describe that data so everyone knows what is available  
If you're not sure your data is the right fit - just ask  
If your data is very large - then we can point you to places that are able to host that for you  
If you don't know how to license your data - we can help
